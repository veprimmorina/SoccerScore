### Test-Driven Development (TDD) Methodology

The implementation of the **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** methodology in this project is carried out as follows:

1. **Specification of Functionality**  
   Defining the functions to be implemented in the application.

2. **Writing the Tests**  
   After the specification, tests for those functions are written.

3. **Code Implementation**  
   Implementing the relevant functionality in the code.

4. **Running Tests**  
   Executing the tests that have been pre-selected for that functionality.

5. **Retry**  
   After completing the functionality, the execution of the tests is retried.
